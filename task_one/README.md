# Task One Overview

For this task, I used SQL to clean up the given datasets. Each question, independent of each other, has its own corresponding .sql folder with a .csv file output.

Here are the questions I answered:

Question 1 - Compute the GDP of each year of each country. It's the summation of the GDP in each state. If you're comfortable using SQL,please do this using SQL.

Question 2 - Compute the "Happiness Score" of each year of each country. It's the average of the score in each state.

Question 3 - Join the country-year level GDP, Score, and region data together into one data table with the following columns: Country, REgion, Year, GDP, Score.

Question 4 - Sort the rows in the following way: Firstly by ascending order of year. So the first chunk of rows should be 2015 data, next chunk should be 2016 data... Within each chunk, sort by descending order of happiness score.
